# service-fabric-stateless-secure-remoting
> A simple codebase to demonstrate secure remoting between two stateless Service Fabric services

This solution has three projects
 * SecureRemoting - Service Fabric project
 * RemoteService - Stateless service which implements a Service interface defined in WebService
 * WebService - Stateless service that consumes the RemoteService through Service Fabric remoting
